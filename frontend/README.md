Added:
- Ad Nauseam; 2
- Necropotence: 1;
- Tainted Pact: 2;
- Food Chain: 1;
- Hermit Druid: 1;
- Isochron Scepter: 1; - Might be better to add Dramatic Reversal instead, as Isochron has more 'fair' uses.

Changed:
- Thrasios: 3 to 2; Creates room for Tymna on the list

I only added Spleenfaces recommendations at one point less than recommeneded. I want to avoid over pointing things at the start, unless it's completely justified and minimize the size of the list.
